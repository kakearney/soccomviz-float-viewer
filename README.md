### SOCCOM floats

This is a prototype of a map viewer that shows the float tracks of the Argo floats released as part of the  [SOCCOM](http://soccom.princeton.edu/soccomviz.php) program.

This is currently a work in progress.  Right now the data is loaded from local files rather than the MBARI-hosted up-to-date ones, due to some mixed content errors that I can't seem to get around (MBARI hosts the files on http, which browsers don't seem to like).

Use mouse scroll wheel to zoom, click and drag to pan.  Hovering over a float will give some information about that float in the box in the lower left, along with a link to download the underlying data.
